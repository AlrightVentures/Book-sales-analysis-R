# Book-sales-analysis-R
Creating efficient data analysis workflow in R using book sales dataset.

In this project I we will be performing analysis for a company that sells books for a programming education. The company wrote multiple books, which received many reviews. I want to check out the sales data and see if I can identify the most profitable book.
